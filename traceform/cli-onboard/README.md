## Installation

Run with `npx` in your project root:

```bash
npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
```

---

## Quickstart

1. In your React project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
   ```
2. Follow the interactive wizard in your terminal.

---

## Use Cases
- **First-Time Setup:** Get Traceform working in minutes, even in complex monorepos.
- **Team Onboarding:** Standardize setup for new developers.
- **Troubleshooting:** Quickly verify and debug your Traceform installation.

---

## Why Traceform Onboarding CLI?

Setting up a multi-part toolchain can be error prone. The Onboarding CLI removes the guesswork, automates checks, and provides clear, contextual instructions for every step. It ensures your Traceform workflow is ready to go.

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Wizard Flow

The CLI guides you through the following steps:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Checks for Node.js (minimum version: **18.17.0**) and a supported package manager:
     - npm (>= 8.0.0)
     - yarn (>= 1.22.0)
     - pnpm (>= 7.0.0)
   - Prompts you to fix any missing prerequisites before continuing.
2. **Babel Plugin Setup**
   - Checks for `@lucidlayer/babel-plugin-traceform` in your `package.json`.
   - If missing, provides the correct install command for your package manager.
   - Detects your project type (Vite, Create React App, Next.js, or custom Babel) and offers a tailored config snippet.
   - Does **not** modify your files automatically—copy/paste the snippet as needed.
3. **VS Code Extension**
   - Prompts you to install the [Traceform VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LucidLayer.traceform-vscode).
   - Press Enter to confirm once installed.
4. **Browser Extension**
   - Prompts you to install the [Traceform Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/giidcepndnnabhfkopmgcnpnnilkaefa?utm_source=item-share-cb).
   - Press Enter to confirm once installed.
5. **Final Validation**
   - Provides a checklist to validate your setup:
     - Start your React dev server (e.g., `npm run dev`).
     - Check the Traceform VS Code extension sidebar for "client connected".
     - Open your app in the browser.
     - Use "Traceform: Find Component in UI" in VS Code.
     - Look for highlighted components in the browser.
   - If validation fails, troubleshooting tips are provided.

- **Progress Indicator:** Each step shows "Step X of Y" at the top.


### Technical Details

- Built with Node.js and [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) for a modern TUI experience.
- Uses `fs-extra`, `execa`, `clipboardy`, and other utilities for project inspection and user guidance.
- No subcommands or arguments, just run the CLI and follow the wizard.
- **Does not modify your files automatically.** All configuration changes are manual (copy/paste from the wizard).
- Works in monorepos and detects common project setups.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Do I need to install this globally?**  
A: No, just use `npx` for the latest version every time.

**Q: Does this modify my project files?**  
A: No. The CLI only provides config snippets and install commands. You must copy/paste them yourself.

**Q: Can I use this in a monorepo?**  
A: Yes, the CLI detects monorepo roots and works with common setups.

**Q: What if something fails validation?**  
A: The wizard provides troubleshooting tips and links to documentation for each step.

**Q: What are the minimum requirements?**  
A: Node.js >= 18.17.0 and one of npm >= 8, yarn >= 1.22, or pnpm >= 7.

**Q: How do I opt out of telemetry?**  
A: Set the environment variable `TRACEFORM_TELEMETRY=off` before running the CLI.
