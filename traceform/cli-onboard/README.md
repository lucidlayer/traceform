# Traceform CLI: Fast Onboarding & Debugging Setup for Teams

> The Traceform CLI is designed for teams facing **hypothesized** high friction during onboarding, debugging, and navigating unfamiliar or legacy React codebases. It **aims** to accelerate setup and reduce debugging friction for these teams, especially leads and managers.
>
> **Our core hypothesis, currently undergoing validation via pilot programs, is that Traceform significantly saves time.** If validated time savings is <50%, Traceform will be positioned as 'best-in-class for onboarding and legacy debugging.'

## Why Use the Traceform CLI? (Intended Benefits)
- **For team leads and managers:** Designed to ensure your team can get Traceform running quickly, potentially reducing setup time.
- Automates setup for the Traceform toolchain: VS Code extension, Babel plugin, and browser extension.
- **Goal:** Reduce onboarding time and debugging friction for new hires and contractors.
- **Hypothesis:** Works best in large, complex, or legacy React projects where manual setup is a significant blocker.

## Quickstart

*Get your team up and running in minutes:*

1. In your React project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
   ```
2. Follow the CLI wizard to install and configure all required Traceform tools.
3. Start your dev server, open your app in the browser, and try Traceform!

## How It Works
- The CLI checks your project for compatibility and guides you through setup.
- Installs and configures the VS Code extension, Babel plugin, and browser extension.
- **Aims** to ensure your team can see code-to-UI mappings instantly, with no manual steps.

## Note on Claims & Updates
- **Claims are currently hypotheses undergoing validation via pilot programs.**
- If validated time savings is <50%, fallback messaging is: 'Best-in-class for onboarding and legacy debugging.'
- This README is reviewed and updated quarterly based on pilot data and buyer feedback.
