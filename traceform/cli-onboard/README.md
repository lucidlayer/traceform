## Installation

You don't need to install globally. Just run it with `npx` in your project root:

```bash
npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
```

---

## Quickstart

1. In your React project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
   ```
2. Follow the interactive wizard. The onboarding flow is now:
   - Minimal, step-by-step, and easy to follow
   - Each step shows a simple progress indicator (e.g., "Step 2 of 5")
   - Clear, actionable instructions for:
     - Checking your environment (Node.js, package manager)
     - Installing and verifying the Traceform VS Code extension
     - Installing and configuring the Traceform Babel plugin
     - Installing the Traceform browser extension
     - Validating the full toolchain with "Find Component in UI"
   - No advanced UI, splash screens, or automationâ€”just clear guidance
   - Telemetry is opt-out (see below)
   - For CI/headless use, run with `--no-ui` (if supported)

---

## Use Cases
- **First-Time Setup:** Get Traceform working in minutes, even in complex monorepos.
- **Team Onboarding:** Standardize setup for new developers.
- **Troubleshooting:** Quickly verify and debug your Traceform installation.

---

## Why Traceform Onboarding CLI?

Setting up a multi-part toolchain can be error-prone. The Onboarding CLI removes the guesswork, automates checks, and provides clear, contextual instructions for every step. It ensures your Traceform workflow is ready to go.

---

## How It Works

- **Environment Check:** Verifies Node.js and package manager versions.
- **Component Guidance:**
  - Checks for the VS Code extension and provides install instructions.
  - Scans for the Babel plugin in your `package.json` and config files, offering a minimal setup snippet if needed.
  - Guides you through manual installation of the browser extension.
- **Validation:** Offers a final checklist to confirm the entire toolchain is working, using "Find Component in UI".
- **Progress Indicator:** Each step shows "Step X of Y" at the top.
- **Telemetry:** Anonymous usage telemetry is enabled by default. To opt out, set the environment variable `TRACEFORM_TELEMETRY=off` before running the CLI.

### Technical Details

- Built with Node.js
- Uses `commander`, `inquirer`, `chalk`, `fs-extra`, and `execa` for a smooth CLI experience
- Scans project files and provides tailored setup instructions for Babel, Vite, and more
