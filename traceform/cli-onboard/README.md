![Traceform CLI onboarding walkthrough](../../.github/onboarding.gif)

> Get set up in minutes with the Traceform CLI. The fastest way to go from zero to 'aha'—see your code, live, in the UI.

---

## Why Use the CLI?
- Automates setup for the full Traceform toolchain.
- Ensures you're ready to see your code, live, in the UI—no manual config headaches.
- Perfect for onboarding yourself or your whole team.

## How It Works
1. Checks prerequisites (Node.js, package manager).
2. Installs and configures everything you need (VS Code extension, Babel plugin, browser extension).
3. Guides you to your first 'aha' moment: click code, see it on screen.

---

## Quickstart

1. In your React project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
   ```
2. Follow the interactive wizard in your terminal.
3. Start your dev server, open your app in the browser, and try Traceform!
