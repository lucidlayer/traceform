# Traceform Babel Plugin: For Teams Onboarding & Debugging React Codebases

> The Traceform Babel plugin is designed for onboarding, debugging, and navigating unfamiliar or legacy React codebasesâ€”where existing tools break down. It is not for every developer, every day, but for teams and leads who need to accelerate onboarding and reduce debugging friction in real, production-scale projects.
>
> **All claims are based on real, production-scale pilots.** If time savings is <50%, Traceform is positioned as 'best-in-class for onboarding and legacy debugging.'

## Why This Plugin?
- **For team leads and managers:** Enable your team to instantly map code to UI, reducing onboarding and debugging time.
- Powers Traceform's instant, live code-to-UI mapping experience.
- Works with all modern React setups (Vite, Next.js, Create React App, etc.).
- Development-only, zero production overhead.

## How It Works
1. Hooks into Babel's compilation process.
2. Finds React components and injects a unique `data-traceform-id` into the root JSX element.
3. IDs are used by the Traceform toolchain to instantly map code to UI.

---

## Quickstart
1. Install the plugin:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @lucidlayer/babel-plugin-traceform
   ```
2. Add it to your Babel or Vite config (development only).
3. Use the Traceform VS Code and browser extensions for instant code-to-UI mapping.
