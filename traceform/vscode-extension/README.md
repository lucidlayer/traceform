# Traceform VS Code Extension: For Teams Onboarding & Debugging React Codebases

> The Traceform VS Code extension is designed for **hypothesized** high-friction scenarios like onboarding, debugging, and navigating unfamiliar or legacy React codebases. It is **intended for** teams and leads who need tools to potentially accelerate onboarding and reduce debugging friction.
>
> **Our core hypothesis, currently undergoing validation via pilot programs, is that Traceform significantly saves time.** If validated time savings is <50%, Traceform will be positioned as 'best-in-class for onboarding and legacy debugging.'
