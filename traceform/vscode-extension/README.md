## Why Use This Extension?

The Traceform VS Code extension helps teams quickly understand and navigate React codebases by visually connecting components in your editor to their rendered instances in the browser.

- **Efficient Debugging**: Click a component in VS Code and see the problematic element light up on-screen instantly.
- **Code Navigation**: Map code to UI in large or unfamiliar React codebases with zero DOM sleuthing.
- **Fast Onboarding**: New team members immediately visualize component locations without digging through code.
