## Task Definition
Modify the integrated bridge server logic within the VSCode extension (`src/bridgeServer.ts`) to check if the designated port (9901) is already in use before attempting to start. If the port is occupied, prevent the server from starting and display an informative error notification to the user via the VSCode UI. Do not attempt to terminate the conflicting process automatically.

## Subtasks
1. ⏱️ SUBTASK_009.1: "Implement Port Check Logic"
   - Goal: Add code to `bridgeServer.ts` using Node.js `net` module or similar to check if port 9901 is available before `server.listen()`.
   - Required contexts: `code-to-ui-mapper/vscode-extension/src/bridgeServer.ts`
   - Output: Function that returns true if port is free, false otherwise.
   - Dependencies: None
   - Completed: 2025-04-13
   - Summary: Added `isPortInUse` helper function using `net` module.

2. ✅ SUBTASK_009.2: "Integrate Check into Start Sequence"
   - Goal: Modify the server start function in `bridgeServer.ts` to call the port check function.
   - Required contexts: `code-to-ui-mapper/vscode-extension/src/bridgeServer.ts`
   - Output: Updated start sequence logic.
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_009.1
   - Completed: 2025-04-13
   - Summary: Made `startBridgeServer` async and added `await isPortInUse(PORT)` check before proceeding.

3. ✅ SUBTASK_009.3: "Implement Error Notification"
   - Goal: If port check fails, use `vscode.window.showErrorMessage` to notify the user about the conflict. Update internal server status.
   - Required contexts: `code-to-ui-mapper/vscode-extension/src/bridgeServer.ts`, `vscode` API
   - Output: Error notification logic integrated.
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_009.2
   - Completed: 2025-04-13
   - Summary: Added `vscode.window.showErrorMessage` call and error throwing within the port check block.

## Integration Notes
This change enhances the robustness of the integrated bridge server startup process. It avoids potential issues caused by port conflicts without resorting to risky automatic process termination.
