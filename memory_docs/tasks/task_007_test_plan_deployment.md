## Task Definition
Create a formal test plan (test cases, expected results, edge cases, validation protocols) and a deployment/integration guide for running, testing, and validating the full system.

## Subtasks
1. ⏱️ SUBTASK_007.1: "Test Plan"
   - Goal: Define unit, integration, and manual test cases for all subprojects and cross-project flows.
   - Required contexts: progress.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: test_plan.md or section in progress.md
   - Dependencies: None

2. ⏱️ SUBTASK_007.2: "Validation Protocols"
   - Goal: Specify validation checkpoints, acceptance criteria, and edge case handling for each subproject.
   - Required contexts: progress.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: validation_protocols.md or section in progress.md
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_007.1

3. ⏱️ SUBTASK_007.3: "Deployment & Integration Guide"
   - Goal: Document step-by-step instructions for running, testing, and validating the full system (local dev, integration, troubleshooting).
   - Required contexts: techContext.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: deployment_guide.md or section in docs/
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_007.2

## Generated Decisions
<!-- List any new decisions that arise during implementation -->

## Integration Notes
- Test plan should cover all validation checkpoints and edge cases.
- Deployment guide should be clear, stepwise, and cross-platform.
- All documentation must be kept up to date as the system evolves.
