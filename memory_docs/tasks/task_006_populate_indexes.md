## Task Definition
Populate the YAML index files in memory_docs/indexes/ with up-to-date entries for all components, services, utilities, and models in the monorepo.

## Subtasks
1. ⏱️ SUBTASK_006.1: "Component Index"
   - Goal: Add all React components, extension modules, and their parameters/relationships to components_index.yaml.
   - Required contexts: codeMap_root.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: components_index.yaml
   - Dependencies: None

2. ⏱️ SUBTASK_006.2: "Service Index"
   - Goal: Add all bridge server endpoints, extension background services, and communication protocols to services_index.yaml.
   - Required contexts: codeMap_root.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: services_index.yaml
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_006.1

3. ⏱️ SUBTASK_006.3: "Utils Index"
   - Goal: Add all utility functions and helpers to utils_index.yaml.
   - Required contexts: codeMap_root.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: utils_index.yaml
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_006.2

4. ⏱️ SUBTASK_006.4: "Models Index"
   - Goal: Add all data models and types to models_index.yaml.
   - Required contexts: codeMap_root.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: models_index.yaml
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_006.3

## Generated Decisions
<!-- List any new decisions that arise during implementation -->

## Integration Notes
- Indexes should be kept up to date as the codebase evolves.
- YAML entries should use compressed, reference-friendly format.
- Cross-reference IDs and relationships for easy navigation.
