## Task Definition
Implement a Node.js WebSocket server that bridges communication between the VS Code extension and the browser extension, relaying highlight commands.

## Subtasks
1. ✅ SUBTASK_004.1: "Project Setup"
   - Goal: Initialize TypeScript Node.js project with strict lint/format.
   - Required contexts: systemPatterns.md, techContext.md
   - Output: package.json, tsconfig.json, .eslintrc.js, .prettierrc, src/
   - Dependencies: None
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T19:28:59Z
   - Summary: Created config files, src/index.ts placeholder, installed deps.

2. ✅ SUBTASK_004.2: "WebSocket Server Implementation"
   - Goal: Implement WebSocket server to listen on ws://localhost:8765, handle connections.
   - Required contexts: ws docs, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: src/index.ts
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_004.1
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T19:29:13Z
   - Summary: Implemented basic WebSocket server using 'ws' library.

3. ✅ SUBTASK_004.3: "Message Protocol & Validation"
   - Goal: Define and validate message schema, broadcast highlight commands to all clients.
   - Required contexts: systemPatterns.md, progress.md
   - Output: src/index.ts with protocol logic
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_004.2
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T19:29:48Z
   - Summary: Added message parsing, validation, and broadcasting logic.

4. ✅ SUBTASK_004.4: "Error Handling & Robustness"
   - Goal: Handle port conflicts, malformed messages, disconnects, and logging.
   - Required contexts: Node.js docs, progress.md
   - Output: src/index.ts with robust error handling
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_004.3
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T19:30:02Z
   - Summary: Added specific error handling for EADDRINUSE and graceful shutdown.

5. ⏱️ SUBTASK_004.5: "Testing"
   - Goal: Add unit and manual tests for message validation and broadcast logic.
   - Required contexts: test framework docs, progress.md
   - Output: test/ or __tests__/ with test cases
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_004.4
   - Status: Deferred until dependent components are implemented.

6. ✅ SUBTASK_004.6: "Documentation & Validation"
   - Goal: Document usage, troubleshooting, and run manual validation with VS Code and browser extensions.
   - Required contexts: README template, extension docs
   - Output: README.md, manual test results
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_004.5

## Generated Decisions
<!-- List any new decisions that arise during implementation -->

## Integration Notes
- Must work with both VS Code and browser extensions.
- All code must pass lint/format and tests before completion.
- Message protocol must be strictly validated.
