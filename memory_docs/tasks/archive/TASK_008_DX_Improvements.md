## Task Definition
Improve the developer experience for setting up and using the Code-to-UI Mapper toolset on new projects by publishing key components and integrating the bridge server into the VS Code extension.

## Subtasks
1.  ✅ SUBTASK_008.1: "Integrate Bridge Server into VS Code Extension"
    - Goal: Modify the VS Code extension to automatically start, manage, and stop the bridge server process, eliminating the need for manual server management. Address port conflict detection.
    - Required contexts: `vscode-extension/src/extension.ts`, `vscode-extension/src/client.ts`, `local-bridge-server/src/index.ts`, `decisions.md`
    - Status: Completed
    - Completed: 2025-04-12T22:59:45Z
    - Summary: Created `vscode-extension/src/bridgeServer.ts` with adapted server logic. Updated `extension.ts` to call `startBridgeServer` on activation and `stopBridgeServer` on deactivation. Updated `client.ts` to import stop function (though primary stop is in `extension.ts`).
    - Output: Updated VS Code extension source code (`extension.ts`, `client.ts`, `bridgeServer.ts`).
    - Dependencies: None

2.  ✅ SUBTASK_008.2: "Prepare & Publish Babel Plugin"
    - Goal: Prepare the `babel-plugin-inject-id` package for publishing to npm and guide the user through the publishing process.
    - Required contexts: `babel-plugin-inject-id/package.json`, `babel-plugin-inject-id/README.md`
    - Status: Completed
    - Completed: 2025-04-12T23:33:14Z # Approximate time of completion
    - Summary: Updated package version to 0.1.1 and successfully published `@lucidlayer/babel-plugin-traceform` to npm.
    - Output: Published npm package (`@lucidlayer/babel-plugin-traceform@0.1.1`).
    - Dependencies: None

3.  ✅ SUBTASK_008.3: "Prepare & Publish VS Code Extension"
    - Goal: Prepare the `code-to-ui-mapper-vscode-extension` package for publishing to the VS Code Marketplace and guide the user through the packaging and publishing process.
    - Required contexts: `vscode-extension/package.json`, `vscode-extension/README.md`
    - Status: Completed
    - Completed: 2025-04-12T23:46:37Z # Approximate time of completion
    - Summary: Updated package.json with publisher 'LucidLayer', set private to false, packaged extension with 'vsce package', and published version 0.1.0 with 'vsce publish'.
    - Output: Published VS Code Marketplace extension (`LucidLayer.code-to-ui-mapper-vscode-extension@0.1.0`).
    - Dependencies: SUBTASK_008.1 (as server logic is integrated)

4.  ✅ SUBTASK_008.4: "Update Documentation for New Setup"
    - Goal: Update all relevant READMEs and guides (especially `docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md`) to reflect the simplified setup process (installation via registries, no manual server start).
    - Required contexts: `README.md`, `docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md`, other component READMEs.
    - Status: Completed
    - Completed: 2025-04-12T23:58:16Z # Approximate time of completion
    - Summary: Updated test_plan_and_deployment.md, root README, VS Code Ext README, Browser Ext README, Example App README, and Local Bridge Server README to reflect published packages and integrated server.
    - Output: Updated documentation files.
    - Dependencies: SUBTASK_008.1, SUBTASK_008.2, SUBTASK_008.3

## Generated Decisions
- [#DX_001] Integrate Bridge Server logic directly into VS Code extension activation/deactivation lifecycle.
- [#DX_002] Publish Babel Plugin to npm and VS Code Extension to Marketplace for standard installation. (Browser Extension publishing deferred).

## Integration Notes
- Port conflict handling for the integrated server needs careful implementation (check port, notify user, do not auto-kill).
- User action will be required for `npm publish` and `vsce publish`.
- Browser extension installation remains manual ("Load unpacked") for now.
