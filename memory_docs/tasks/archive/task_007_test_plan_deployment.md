## Task Definition
Create a formal test plan (test cases, expected results, edge cases, validation protocols) and a deployment/integration guide for running, testing, and validating the full system.

## Subtasks
1. ✅ SUBTASK_007.1: "Test Plan"
   - Goal: Define unit, integration, and manual test cases for all subprojects and cross-project flows.
   - Required contexts: progress.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Status: Completed
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T20:57:39Z
   - Summary: Added detailed unit, integration, and manual test cases to `code-to-ui-mapper/docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md`.
   - Output: `code-to-ui-mapper/docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md` (updated)
   - Dependencies: None

2. ✅ SUBTASK_007.2: "Validation Protocols"
   - Goal: Specify validation checkpoints, acceptance criteria, and edge case handling for each subproject.
   - Required contexts: progress.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Status: Completed
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T21:00:25Z
   - Summary: Added "Validation Protocols" section to `code-to-ui-mapper/docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md`, covering checkpoints, criteria, and edge cases.
   - Output: `code-to-ui-mapper/docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md` (updated)
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_007.1

3. ✅ SUBTASK_007.3: "Deployment & Integration Guide"
   - Goal: Document step-by-step instructions for running, testing, and validating the full system (local dev, integration, troubleshooting).
   - Required contexts: techContext.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Status: Completed
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T21:01:21Z
   - Summary: Refined the "Deployment & Integration Guide" section in `code-to-ui-mapper/docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md` with detailed setup, execution, validation, and troubleshooting steps for local development.
   - Output: `code-to-ui-mapper/docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md` (updated)
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_007.2

## Generated Decisions
<!-- List any new decisions that arise during implementation -->

## Integration Notes
- Test plan covers all validation checkpoints and edge cases.
- Deployment guide provides clear, stepwise instructions for local setup and testing.
- All documentation must be kept up to date as the system evolves.
- **Task Summary:** Successfully created and refined the comprehensive test plan, validation protocols, and deployment guide located in `code-to-ui-mapper/docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md`. This document provides the necessary steps and checks to ensure the system functions correctly and can be set up reliably for development and testing.
