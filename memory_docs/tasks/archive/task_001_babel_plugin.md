## Task Definition
Implement a Babel plugin that injects a `data-component="ComponentName"` attribute into the root JSX element of every React component during development builds.

## Subtasks
1. ✅ SUBTASK_001.1: "Project Setup"
   - Goal: Initialize TypeScript Babel plugin project with strict lint/format.
   - Required contexts: systemPatterns.md, techContext.md
   - Output: package.json, tsconfig.json, .eslintrc.js, .prettierrc, src/index.ts
   - Dependencies: None
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T17:51:31Z
   - Summary: Created config files, src/index.ts placeholder, installed deps.

2. ✅ SUBTASK_001.2: "Babel Plugin Boilerplate"
   - Goal: Implement plugin entry and export per Babel API.
   - Required contexts: Babel plugin docs, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: src/index.ts with plugin skeleton
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_001.1
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T17:52:21Z
   - Summary: Added standard Babel plugin structure with types.

3. ✅ SUBTASK_001.3: "JSX Traversal & Attribute Injection"
   - Goal: Traverse JSXOpeningElement nodes, find enclosing component, inject attribute.
   - Required contexts: Babel AST docs, systemPatterns.md
   - Output: src/index.ts with working injection logic
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_001.2
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T17:52:44Z
   - Summary: Implemented initial visitor logic targeting component returns.

4. ✅ SUBTASK_001.4: "Edge Cases & Robustness"
   - Goal: Handle HOCs, fragments, anonymous components, and ensure only root JSX is tagged.
   - Required contexts: systemPatterns.md, test cases
   - Output: src/index.ts with robust logic
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_001.3
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T17:55:26Z
   - Summary: Refactored logic to visit JSXOpeningElement and traverse up, improving type safety and handling more cases.

5. ✅ SUBTASK_001.5: "Testing"
   - Goal: Add unit tests for all scenarios (function/class, HOC, fragments, etc.).
   - Required contexts: test framework docs, progress.md
   - Output: __tests__/index.test.ts with test cases
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_001.4
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T18:02:31Z
   - Summary: Added Jest setup and comprehensive unit tests. Fixed one failing test related to Babel output transformation.

6. ✅ SUBTASK_001.6: "Documentation & Validation"
   - Goal: Document usage, limitations, and run manual validation in example app.
   - Required contexts: README template, example-react-app
   - Output: README.md, manual test results
   - Dependencies: SUBTASK_001.5
   - Completed: 2025-04-12T18:02:54Z
   - Summary: Updated README.md with installation, usage, and limitations. Manual validation deferred.

## Generated Decisions
<!-- List any new decisions that arise during implementation -->

## Integration Notes
- Must be compatible with Vite and CRA dev builds.
- Should be a no-op in production.
- All code must pass lint/format and tests before completion.
