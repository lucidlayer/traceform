## Current Focus
- Finalized, foolproof plan for Code-to-UI Mapper MVP (VS Code ↔ Bridge Server ↔ Browser Extension ↔ Instrumented React App).
- All subprojects have detailed, stepwise implementation plans, validation checkpoints, and integration points.
- Preparing to transition from planning to execution phase.

## Recent Changes
- Completed exhaustive planning protocol for all subprojects.
- Updated codeMap_root.md with full project structure and flow diagrams.
- Locked in TypeScript, Node 18.17+, Chrome/Edge targets, strict lint/format, and cross-platform support.

## Active Decisions
- All code in TypeScript, strict mode.
- Monorepo with npm workspaces, shared config.
- Chrome/Edge as primary browser extension targets.
- WebSocket protocol for all inter-process communication.
- Airbnb + Prettier lint/format enforced everywhere.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Update all memory docs to reflect finalized plan and context.
2. Prepare for execution: scaffold, implement, and validate each subproject in order.
3. Maintain documentation and validation checkpoints throughout execution.
