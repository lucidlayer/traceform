## Active Decisions
- [#DX_001] Integrate Bridge Server logic directly into VS Code extension activation/deactivation lifecycle. (Implemented in TASK_008)
- [#DX_002] Publish Babel Plugin to npm and VS Code Extension to Marketplace for standard installation. (Browser Extension publishing deferred). (Implemented in TASK_008)
- All code in TypeScript, strict mode.
- Monorepo with npm workspaces, shared config.
- Chrome/Edge as primary browser extension targets.
- WebSocket protocol for all inter-process communication.
- Airbnb + Prettier lint/format enforced everywhere.
- [#DX_003] Handle Bridge Server Port Conflict (9901) by checking port and notifying user, not killing process. (Implemented in TASK_009)

## Immediate Priorities
- None. Awaiting user direction.
