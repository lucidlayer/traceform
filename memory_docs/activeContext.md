# Active Context
timestamp: 2025-04-13T11:46:00Z # Updated timestamp - Planning TASK_009

## Current Focus
- Project v0.1 (MVP + DX improvements) is complete.
- Awaiting next steps, potential bug fixes, or feature requests.

## Recent Changes
- Completed implementation tasks TASK_001 through TASK_008.
- Integrated Bridge Server into VS Code Extension [TASK_008].
- Published Babel Plugin (`@lucidlayer/babel-plugin-traceform@0.1.1`) and VS Code Extension (`LucidLayer.code-to-ui-mapper-vscode-extension@0.1.0`) [TASK_008].
- Added competitor analysis to `productContext.md`.
- Updated all core memory documents (`codeMap_root.md`, `progress.md`, `task_registry.md`, `activeContext.md`) with latest timestamps and status.

## Active Decisions
- [#DX_001] Integrate Bridge Server logic directly into VS Code extension activation/deactivation lifecycle. (Implemented in TASK_008)
- [#DX_002] Publish Babel Plugin to npm and VS Code Extension to Marketplace for standard installation. (Browser Extension publishing deferred). (Implemented in TASK_008)
- All code in TypeScript, strict mode.
- Monorepo with npm workspaces, shared config.
- Chrome/Edge as primary browser extension targets.
- WebSocket protocol for all inter-process communication.
- Airbnb + Prettier lint/format enforced everywhere.
- [#DX_003] Handle Bridge Server Port Conflict (9901) by checking port and notifying user, not killing process. (Added 2025-04-13)

## Immediate Priorities
- Implement TASK_009: Bridge Server Port Conflict Handling.
