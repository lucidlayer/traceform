## Current Focus
- Code-to-UI Mapper MVP implementation is complete and core end-to-end functionality has been verified through local testing setup.
- All core components (Babel plugin, Browser extension, VS Code extension, Bridge server, Example app) are functional.
- Test plan and deployment guide are documented in `code-to-ui-mapper/docs/test_plan_and_deployment.md`.

## Recent Changes
- Completed implementation tasks TASK_001 through TASK_007.
- Successfully executed end-to-end tests for the core highlighting feature.
- Resolved various build and configuration issues encountered during testing setup (port conflicts, build scripts, linking, launch config).
- Updated all relevant memory docs (`codeMap_root.md`, `progress.md`, `task_registry.md`) and project README.

## Active Decisions
- All code in TypeScript, strict mode.
- Monorepo with npm workspaces, shared config.
- Chrome/Edge as primary browser extension targets.
- WebSocket protocol for all inter-process communication.
- Airbnb + Prettier lint/format enforced everywhere.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Address minor refinements or bugs identified during testing (e.g., highlighting non-visible components, improving VS Code component name inference).
2. Consider packaging extensions for easier distribution/installation.
3. Define and plan post-MVP features or enhancements.
