![Traceform demo: Instantly highlight every instance of a component from VS Code to browser](./.github/demo.gif)

Traceform bridges VSÂ Code and your running React app, highlighting every rendered instance of a component directly in your browser UI.

## Why Traceform?

Ever spent minutes hunting through DevTools or manually inspecting the DOM to find where a component actually renders? Traceform cuts that down to seconds:

- **Efficient Debugging**: Click a component in VSÂ Code and see the problematic element light up on-screen instantly.
- **Legacy Code Navigation**: Map code to UI in large or unfamiliar React codebases with zero DOM sleuthing.
- **Fast Onboarding**: New team members immediately visualize component locations without digging through code.

> **Note:** Setup takes under 3 minutes. Thatâ€™s paid back after your first bug fix.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** (v14+) installed.
2. In your React project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
   ```
3. Follow the CLI prompts to install:
   - VSÂ Code extension
   - Babel plugin
   - Browser extension
4. Start your development server and open your app. Click any component in VSÂ Code to see it highlighted.
