![Traceform demo: Instantly highlight every instance of a component from VS Code to browser](./.github/demo.gif)

Traceform bridges VS Code and your running React app, highlighting every rendered instance of a component directly in your browser UI.

---

## Why Traceform?

Ever spent minutes hunting through DevTools or manually inspecting the DOM to find where a component actually renders? Traceform cuts that down to seconds:

- **Efficient Debugging**: Click a component in VS Code and see the problematic element light up on-screen instantly.
- **Legacy Code Navigation**: Map code to UI in large or unfamiliar React codebases with zero DOM sleuthing.
- **Fast Onboarding**: New team members immediately visualize component locations without digging through code.

## How It Works

1. **Install**
   ```bash
   npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
   ```
2. **Select**
   Click a component name in your VS Code editor.
3. **Highlight**
   Watch every matching element light up in your browser in real-time.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** (v14+) installed.
2. In your React project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
   ```
3. Follow the CLI prompts to install:
   - VS Code extension
   - Babel plugin
   - Browser extension
4. Start your development server and open your app. Click any component in VS Code to see it highlighted.
