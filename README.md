![Traceform demo: Instantly highlight every instance of a component from VS Code to browser](https://github.com/lucidlayer/traceform/blob/main/.github/demo.gif?raw=true)

## Why Traceform?

Traceform bridges VS Code and your running React app, instantly highlighting every rendered instance of a component directly in your browser UI.

- **Efficient Debugging:** Click a component in VS Code and see the corresponding element light up in your app instantly.
- **Legacy Code Navigation:** Map code to UI in large or unfamiliar React codebases with zero DOM searching.
- **Fast Onboarding:** New team members immediately visualize component locations without digging through code.
