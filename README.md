# Traceform: Bridging the Gap Between Code and UI

We've been thinking deeply about developer experience, and today we're excited to share Traceform, a toolchain we built to solve a persistent challenge in React development. With Traceform, you can select any React component in VS Code and instantly see all its rendered instances highlighted in your browser.

## What Traceform Solves



Frontend development complexity continues to grow. When you're navigating a large React codebase, connecting what you're seeing in the browser with the component you're editing becomes a friction point. This is the kind of problem that doesn't sound important until you've wasted hours of your development time on it.

The best developer tools don't just solve problems, they make entire categories of problems disappear.

We've structured Traceform as a monorepo with three core components, **each essential for the end-to-end functionality**:

- **Babel Plugin (`@lucidlayer/babel-plugin-traceform`):** This is **required** to instrument your React components during the build process. It injects unique, traceable IDs into your components' output. Without these IDs, Traceform cannot link the code definition to the rendered elements in the browser.
- **VS Code Extension ([Traceform for VS Code]):** This extension is **required** as it provides the user interface within VS Code, allowing you to select a component. Crucially, it also hosts the WebSocket bridge server that communicates with the browser extension. Without it, you cannot initiate the tracing or relay the necessary information.
- **Browser Extension (Chrome/Edge):** This extension is **required** to receive information from the VS Code extension via the WebSocket connection. It then uses the received component ID to find and visually highlight the corresponding rendered elements in your application running on localhost. Without it, the highlighting in the browser cannot occur.


## Technical Implementation

Traceform creates a direct link between your code editor and browser through an elegant architecture:

1. We instrument your React components during build with unique IDs (using a Babel plugin)
2. Our VS Code extension lets you select a component and find all its instances
3. A WebSocket connection relays this information to a browser extension
4. The browser extension highlights the corresponding elements in your running localhost

## Getting Started

Setting up Traceform in your project is straightforward:

1. Install the VS Code extension from the marketplace
2. Add our Babel plugin to your build (dev mode only)
3. Install the browser extension

For detailed setup instructions and configuration examples, check our [Detailed Setup Instructions](./traceform/README.md).

## What's Next

Our immediate roadmap includes:

- Implementing browser-to-code navigation (the reverse direction)
- Adding support for Firefox and other browsers
- Extending to other frameworks like Vue and Svelte
- Further enhancements based on real-world usage

For V2, we're focused on reducing setup friction, ideally getting from three separate tools to just two or one.

## Learn More

We're documenting our journey building Traceform in our [Developer Blog Index](./blog/README.md), including technical decisions and lessons learned. 

Our latest post, ["Traceform: A Technical Deep Dive"](./blog/2025-04-15-traceform-technical-deep-dive.md), explores the architecture and key decisions that shaped the project.

## Try the Demo Apps

We've included two demo applications that demonstrate Traceform in action:

- **Simple Test App**: A minimal setup to get familiar with the basics
- **Complex Demo**: A more representative example of real world usage

Both demos are pre-configured with the Babel plugin, so you can focus on experiencing the core functionality without additional setup.

## Final Thoughts

The tools we build shape how we think about problems. When the gap between writing code and seeing its impact narrows, creativity flourishes. We hope Traceform helps you build better React applications with less friction.

Remember: the tools we build shape what we can build. Let's make them great.
