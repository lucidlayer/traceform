# Traceform: Now on Chrome Web Store + New CLI Onboarding Tool

We shipped two big updates to Traceform today:

1. Our browser extension is now on the Chrome Web Store
2. We built a CLI tool that makes onboarding simple

## Browser Extension

One click install from the Chrome Web Store means automatic updates and better security. No more zip files or manual updates.

## Onboarding CLI

Traceform has three required components (Babel plugin, VS Code extension, browser extension). Getting them all working used to be a pain. Now just run:

```bash
npx @lucidlayer/traceform-onboard check
```

The CLI tool checks your environment, guides setup, and handles configuration. Should take minutes, not hours.

## This Week's Updates

We've been busy:
- Fixed style conflicts
- Removed unused code
- Added configurable target URLs
- Enabled multi-tab highlighting
- Improved stability everywhere

## Why This Matters

React developers waste too much time mapping UI elements back to code. Traceform connects your editor directly to your browser. See something in the browser, instantly find its code.

Try it now. Feedback is welcome.
