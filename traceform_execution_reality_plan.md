## Initiative: Production-Scale Instrumentation
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–4: NDAs & security reviews
  - Weeks 5–8: Integrate telemetry in pilot codebases
  - Weeks 9–12: Data analysis & report
- **Budget:** $30K legal & security; $10K infra
- **Owner:** Alex (Sales Eng) for pilots; Jamie (Backend Lead) for instrumentation
- **Success Criteria:** Telemetry running in 3 pilot codebases; measured baseline vs. Traceform flow showing ≥X% time saved
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - NDA delays → pre-draft master agreement, parallel outreach to 5+ targets
  - Infra firewalls → use containerized collector, offer on-prem option

## Initiative: Pilot Accounts & LOIs
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–2: Identify 10+ target accounts
  - Weeks 3–8: Outreach, demos, and champion cultivation
  - Weeks 9–16: Secure 3–5 pilot agreements, 2 binding LOIs
- **Budget:** $15K sales travel/meetings; $5K legal
- **Owner:** Alex (Sales Eng), Priya (Founder)
- **Success Criteria:** 3 pilots running, 2 binding LOIs signed
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - Champion attrition → maintain pipeline of 10+ accounts
  - Legal review delays → use template SOW/LOI, start legal early

---

## Initiative: Adjacent Framework Selection
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–2: Design paid survey/ad test
  - Weeks 3–4: Run $1K ad/survey, analyze results
  - Weeks 5–6: Decision on next framework (if any)
- **Budget:** $1K survey/ad spend
- **Owner:** Priya (Founder), Jamie (Backend Lead)
- **Success Criteria:** 100+ responses, clear willingness-to-pay data
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - Low response rate → increase ad spend, use targeted dev newsletters
  - Ambiguous results → run follow-up interviews

---

## Initiative: IDE & CI/CD Moat
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–4: Prototype JetBrains/Codespaces plugin (greenfield repo)
  - Weeks 5–8: CI/CD proof-of-concept with 1–2 friendly teams
  - Weeks 9–12: Maintenance plan, feedback review
- **Budget:** $20K engineering (0.5 FTE), $5K for plugin marketplace fees
- **Owner:** Jamie (Backend Lead), Sam (Platform Eng)
- **Success Criteria:** Plugin/CI step running in 2 orgs, positive feedback
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - JetBrains API breakage → assign Sam to monitor updates, maintain compatibility matrix
  - CI/CD pushback → start with greenfield repo, document performance/security impact

## Initiative: Telemetry & Stress Testing
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–4: Build privacy-first, on-prem telemetry module
  - Weeks 5–8: Deploy in 2 enterprise pilots
  - Weeks 9–12: Document support matrix, rollback plan
- **Budget:** $15K engineering, $5K privacy/legal
- **Owner:** Jamie (Backend Lead), Sam (Platform Eng)
- **Success Criteria:** Telemetry module deployed, support matrix published
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - Enterprise bans on telemetry → offer on-prem, audit-logged version
  - Legacy stack failures → maintain rollback plan, rapid hotfix process

---

## Initiative: Funnel & Churn Outreach
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–2: Design in-product churn prompts
  - Weeks 3–6: Deploy prompts, collect data
  - Weeks 7–8: Analyze and iterate
- **Budget:** $5K UX/design, $5K engineering
- **Owner:** Priya (Founder), Jamie (Backend Lead)
- **Success Criteria:** 20%+ response rate to churn prompts, actionable insights
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - User annoyance → A/B test prompt timing, allow easy dismissal
  - Low response → incentivize feedback (e.g., gift cards)

---

## Initiative: CAC Modeling & LTV
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–2: Design micro-experiments ($500 ad buys)
  - Weeks 3–4: Run ads, collect CAC data
  - Weeks 5–6: Model LTV/payback, adjust pricing
- **Budget:** $2K ad spend, $3K analytics
- **Owner:** Priya (Founder), Alex (Sales Eng)
- **Success Criteria:** Real CAC/LTV data, payback model ≤9 months
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - Low conversion → iterate ad copy, retarget channels
  - High CAC → test new acquisition channels

---

## Initiative: Fallback & Auto-Updates
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–2: Scope fallback/auto-update requirements
  - Weeks 3–6: Build MSI/custom installer for enterprise
  - Weeks 7–8: Test in 2 pilot orgs
- **Budget:** $10K engineering, $5K IT support
- **Owner:** Sam (Platform Eng), Jamie (Backend Lead)
- **Success Criteria:** Auto-update works behind firewalls in 2 orgs
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - Installer bugs → maintain rollback, hotfix process
  - Firewall issues → work with IT, offer manual update option

---

## Initiative: Hiring: Sales vs. Platform
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–2: Define role specs, start outreach
  - Weeks 3–8: Interview, make offers
  - Weeks 9–12: Onboard hires
- **Budget:** $20K recruiter fees, $200K/year salary/stock per hire
- **Owner:** Priya (Founder), Alex (Sales Eng)
- **Success Criteria:** 1 infra sales closer, 1 senior platform engineer hired
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - High comp demands → offer equity, remote/flexible work
  - Slow pipeline → use multiple recruiters, tap network

---

## Initiative: OKRs & Vertical Focus
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–2: Publish public install/user tracker
  - Weeks 3–4: Set 6- and 12-month OKRs

- **Budget:** $2K analytics, $5K sales
- **Owner:** Priya (Founder), Alex (Sales Eng)
- **Success Criteria:** Tracker live, OKRs published, 1 vertical customer signed
- **Blockers & Mitigation:**
  - No baseline data → use early pilot numbers, update monthly

---

## Initiative: Freemium Gates & Pricing Experiments
- **Timeline:**
  - Weeks 1–2: Design soft gate (watermark, delayed features)
  - Weeks 3–6: Run A/B pricing experiments
