## What exact problem are we solving, and why does anyone desperately care?
Traceform solves the persistent pain of mapping code to UI in React apps. Developers waste time hunting through the DOM or DevTools to find where a component is actually rendered. This is especially acute in large, unfamiliar, or legacy codebases. We make it instant: select code, see every live instance in the UI—no more guessing, no more DOM spelunking. Devs care because it saves hours, reduces onboarding friction, and eliminates a major source of debugging frustration.

## Who is our first user, and can we reach them without spending a fortune?
Our first user is a React developer (junior to mid-level) dropped into a large or unfamiliar codebase—especially those onboarding to new teams, contractors, or open-source contributors. We can reach them via dev communities (Discord, Reddit, Twitter), open-source demos, and VS Code/Chrome extension marketplaces, all with minimal spend.

## Why is now the right moment for this solution? What's changed?
React adoption is at an all-time high, codebases are growing, and remote onboarding is the norm. Existing tools (DevTools, IDEs) haven't closed the code-to-UI gap. The rise of component-driven UIs and the pain of context switching make this the right moment. The developer experience market is booming, and teams are investing in productivity.

## What's the 10× better outcome we deliver compared to existing alternatives?
Traceform delivers instant, live, visual mapping from code to UI—something no other tool does. Instead of minutes (or hours) spent hunting, it's one click. We eliminate mental mapping, reduce onboarding time, and make debugging and teaching dramatically faster.

## Can a competent engineer clone our MVP in a week?
A basic version could be prototyped, but the seamless integration (Babel plugin, VS Code, browser extension, real-time mapping, multi-framework support) and UX polish would take much longer. Our head start, technical depth, and user feedback loop are defensible.

## How big is the market if we nail this—and is it investable?
Tens of millions of React developers worldwide, with expansion to Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks. The devtools market is large and growing, with strong SaaS and enterprise upsell potential. This is an investable, high-growth segment.

## What's our unfair advantage that no one else can replicate?
Deep integration across the toolchain (editor, build, browser), a unique real-time mapping protocol, and a focus on the "aha" developer experience. Our early traction, community feedback, and rapid iteration cycle create a moat.

## What are the top three assumptions we're making about users or technology?
1. Developers feel the pain of code-to-UI mapping enough to seek a new tool.
2. Teams will adopt Traceform for onboarding and debugging, not just solo devs.
3. Our approach (Babel + extensions) is robust across real-world React setups.

## How will we test each of those assumptions before writing production code?
- Run user interviews and surveys in dev communities.
- Release MVP to open-source and track onboarding/usage in real teams.
- Test across a wide range of React projects (monorepos, Vite, Next.js, CRA).

## What traction metrics prove real demand today?
- Extension installs and active users.
- Repeat usage (day 2, day 30 retention).
- Community feedback and GitHub stars/issues.
- Onboarding time reduction in pilot teams.

## What's our cost to acquire a user, and what's the lifetime value?
Initial CAC is low (organic, community-driven). LTV grows with team/enterprise adoption and potential paid features (advanced analytics, multi-framework support).

## When do we hit breakeven on a per-user basis?
With a freemium model, breakeven is reached as teams upgrade to paid plans (e.g., advanced features, support, or enterprise integrations). Early focus is on growth and engagement.

## What's the simplest growth loop that gets customers through the door?
- Viral demos (GIFs, videos) shared in dev communities.
- Marketplace listings (VS Code, Chrome).
- Word-of-mouth from onboarding and debugging wins.

## How sticky is our product—will users come back day 2, day 30?
High stickiness for devs working in large/complex codebases or onboarding. Retention is driven by repeated debugging/onboarding needs and team adoption.

## What's our churn rate, and why are users leaving?
Churn is expected from devs in small/simple projects or those who finish onboarding. We'll track and address churn by expanding use cases and frameworks.

## What's the path to sustainable 5–10% weekly growth?
- Continuous product improvement and community engagement.
- Expansion to new frameworks (Vue, Svelte).
- Team/enterprise features and integrations.
- Partnerships with bootcamps, consultancies, and dev tool vendors.

## What's our go-to-market channel, and is it scalable?
- Dev marketplaces (VS Code, Chrome Web Store).
- Community-driven content (demos, blog posts, talks).
- Partnerships and integrations.
- Scalable via digital channels and word-of-mouth.

## Who are our direct and indirect competitors, and why do we win?
- Direct: React DevTools, IDE navigation, source maps.
- Indirect: Onboarding tools, code search platforms.
- We win by delivering instant, live, visual mapping—no one else closes the code-to-UI gap this way.

## What's the biggest risk that could kill us tomorrow?
- React or browser changes break our integration.
- Devs don't feel the pain acutely enough to adopt.

## How are we hedging against that risk right now?
- Continuous testing across React versions and browsers.
- Expanding to other frameworks.
- Ongoing user interviews and feedback loops.

## What regulations could shut us down or slow us to a crawl?
- Browser extension store policies.
- Data privacy (we do not collect user data, minimizing risk).

## Do we have the right domain expertise on the founding team?
Yes—deep experience in devtools, React, browser extensions, and developer onboarding.

## Which key hires must we make in the next 30 days?
- Frontend engineer (multi-framework support).
- DevRel/community manager.
- QA/automation engineer.

## What milestones convert skeptics into believers?
- 10,000+ active installs.
- Documented onboarding time reduction in real teams.
- Expansion to a second framework (e.g., Vue).

## How much runway do we need to reach true product-market fit?
12–18 months, depending on team size and growth rate.

## What's our 18-month vision, and is it defensible?
Traceform is the default code-to-UI mapping tool for all major frontend frameworks, with deep team/enterprise adoption and a thriving community. Defensible via integrations, data, and brand.

## What's our edge in talent recruitment and retention?
- Mission-driven culture (solving real dev pain).
- Remote-friendly, high-autonomy environment.
- Early equity and impact.

## What customer feedback contradicts our core thesis?
- Some senior devs say DevTools/IDE are "good enough."
- We address this by focusing on onboarding, debugging, and large/complex codebases.

## How quickly can we pivot if our primary idea fails?
- Fast—core tech can be adapted to other frameworks, onboarding tools, or code search/visualization products.

## What are the top five metrics investors will demand?
1. Active users (DAU/MAU)
2. Retention (day 2, day 30)
3. Churn rate
4. Conversion to paid/team plans
5. Onboarding/debugging time reduction

## How will we demonstrate traction to those investors?
